            <p>
                Sustainability &#127795; means that a process or state can be maintained at a certain level for as long as is wanted. In the 21st century, it refers generally to how the Earth &#127757; and humans &#128108; can co-exist.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The UAE has a proven track record in sustainable action underpinned by concrete targets and pioneering projects that are deeply rooted in the values of conservation, community &#128108; and tradition. The UAE Government has been implementing policies and practices to strengthen sustainable development at a local and global level.
